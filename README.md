## Elevator Pitch
In a day with so much music being released and so many different options to listen, how do you discover your music identity? I am going to build Snare, a music discovery platform where you share your music listening history and reviews with your friends.

### Key features & :
1. I will use HTML to outline the structure with a recently listened to page, a feed with your friends, a login/sign up page, and a profile. 
2. I will use CSS to make this super cool and pleasing for people to use stylistically.
3. I will use react to help me make components dynamic and load data for listens, and other stuff as such. 
4. I will use a database for the auth, and all of the storage for listening data, friend relationships, and posts
5. Websocket: I will use the websocket to make it so that when a friend posts a review it will update my feed.
